Anomalous Human Activity Detection
Welcome to our repository for the Minor Project focused on Anomalous Human Activity Detection! While we're in the process of uploading the codes, here are some valuable resources we're considering:

Resources

[DenseNet Image Classification Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sohaibanwaar1203/dense-net-image-classification/notebook)
DenseNet-based image classification techniques are ideal for feature extraction and classification tasks in anomalous human activity detection.

[OpenPose Human Pose Estimation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/openpose-human-pose-estimation-method/)
OpenPose, is a renowned human pose estimation method. Understanding OpenPose enables the extraction of pose-related features from images or videos, enhancing the detection of abnormal human activities.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to develop and share our progress on Anomalous Human Activity Detection!
